# Welcome to MPEL
  
MPEL (Motion Planning and Experimentation Library) is a library
written in C++ for solving motion planning problems and experimenting
with planning algorithms. It provides an intuitive syntax and several
components which can be used to build planning algorithms either by
"gluing" the components together or from scratch. The library also
provides user the ability to easily visualize the results thus making
it a great tool for use in classrooms. Browse through the
documentation and tutorials to learn more about the library.


### About

MPEL is being developed at the [Center for
Mechatronics](http://www.iitk.ac.in/robotics/) at [IIT
Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in). The project is supervised by [Dr. Bhaskar
Dasgupta](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~dasgupta). The source code for MPEL
is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/lakshayg/mpel).
